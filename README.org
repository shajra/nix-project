* About this project

This project, Nix-project, assists the setup of other projects with the [[nix][Nix
package manager]] leaning on [[nix-flake][flakes]], an experimental Nix feature.

Specifically, this project helps

- scaffold new projects
- maintain dependencies, which may mix different language ecosystems
- generate Github-oriented documentation with evaluated code blocks
- build and distribute packages, binary or otherwise.

This source's [[file:doc][doc directory]] provides a variety of documents to not only help you
use this project, but to also get an introduction to the Nix ecosystem.

Among other benefits, Nix gives use an incredible amount of control and
repeatability of our software projects. If you don't know much about Nix,
