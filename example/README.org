This is a skeleton project illustrating how to use [[nix-project][shajra/nix-project]] to
build/maintain software projects with Nix.

A =docs-generate= script has been set up in a [[./support][./support]] directory. When called
with no arguments, it will generate Markdown files from [[org][Emacs Org-mode]] files.
This =README.org= file is one such file.

=docs-generate= is configured to execute source blocks. The result will be
written to the Org-mode files in-place, as well as included in the exported
Markdown.

Here's an example source block to illustrate evaluation of =whoami=:

#+name: whoami
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
whoami
#+end_src
