This project supports a still-experimental feature of Nix called /flakes/, which
this guide shows users how to use. [[file:../nix-usage-noflakes.org][Another guide]] explains how to do
everything illustrated in this document, but without flakes.

*_NOTE:_* If you're new to flakes, please read the provided [[file:../nix-introduction.org][supplemental
introduction to Nix]] to understand the experimental nature of flakes and how it
may or may not affect you. Hopefully you'll find these trade-offs acceptable so
you can take advantage of the improved experience flakes offer.
