* Helping non-flakes users

A few users work in organizations or contribute to projects that disallow
experimental features such as flakes.

For these users, this project uses and encourages the use of the [[nix-flake-compat][flake-compat]]
project, which enables an end user who has opted not to enable flakes to at
least access the flake's contents, packages or otherwise.

With flake-compat, end users will have a regular (non-flake) Nix expression they
can evaluate. However, since dependencies are managed with flakes, the project
maintainer must have flakes enabled to manage dependencies (for example,
updating to the latest dependencies with =nix flake update=).

* Documenting an end-user experience

To deal with the transition of the Nix community to flake, this project provides
two user guides:

- [[file:../nix-usage-flakes.org][Nix Usage with Flakes (Recommended) ]]
- [[file:../nix-usage-noflakes.org][Nix Usage without Flakes]]

Links generally steer users to the recommended flakes guide, which then links
users to the non-flakes guide if they have the interest or need.

The non-flakes guide intentionally avoids commands like =nix-shell= and
=nix-channel=. These commands lead users to set the =NIX_PATH= environment
variable, which can lead to unreliable builds.  These are the pitfalls that
motivated the design of flakes.

Though this non-flakes guide avoids the =flakes= experimental feature, it still
invites end users to use the experimental =nix-command= to get the following
subcommands:
- =nix search=
- =nix shell=
- =nix run=

In general, the non-flakes guide only explains the usage of experimental =nix=
subcommands when there exist no other alternatives or when the alternatives are
considered worse for new users.

For example, =nix search= has no alternative within the set of non-experimental
Nix tools, and it's too helpful not to tell users about it. Again, this is an
example of the Nix community leading users to experimental features.

Additionally, =nix shell= and =nix run= are shown as improved alternatives to
=nix-shell=.  =nix-shell= is a complicated tool that has been historically used
for a lot of different purposes:
- debugging the build environments of packages
- creating a developer environment for a package (=nix develop= does this
  better, but only for flakes)
- entering a shell with Nix-build executables on the path (=nix shell= does this
  better)
- running arbitrary commands with Nix-build executables on the path (=nix run=
  does this better)

To cover all of these scenarios, =nix-shell= became so complex it is hard to
explain to new users. =nix-shell= is only best for debugging builds, which is
beyond the scope of the documentation provided by this project.
