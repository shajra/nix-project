#+TITLE: Example Nix-based Project

This is a skeleton project illustrating how to use [[https://github.com/shajra/nix-project][shajra/nix-project]] to
build/maintain software projects with Nix.

Two scripts have been set up in a [[./support][./support]] directory:

- =docs-generate=
- =dependencies-upgrade=

Both are typically run with no arguments. =docs-generate= will generate
Markdown files from Emacs Org-mode files. =dependencies-upgrade= as its name
implies, updates the dependencies.

=docs-generate= is configured to execute source blocks. The result will be
written to the Org-mode files in-place, as well as included in the exported
Markdown.

Here's an example source block to illustrate evaluation of =whoami=:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both
  whoami
#+END_SRC
